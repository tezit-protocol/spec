# TheAICoder Launch Partner Notes

This directory contains implementation updates from TheAICoderV2 (a Next.js-based AI coding platform) as a Tezit protocol launch partner.

Files:
- `LAUNCH_PARTNER_UPDATE.md`: current status and what is implemented
- `CONFORMANCE_MATRIX.md`: spec-area checklist (what is implemented vs planned)
- `FOLLOWUPS.md`: prioritized backlog for interoperability and deeper conformance

Note: code references in these documents point to the TheAICoderV2 codebase, not this Tezit spec repository.
