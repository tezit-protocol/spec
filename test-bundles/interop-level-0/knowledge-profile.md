# Q4 2025 Revenue Analysis

## Summary

Revenue grew 23% year-over-year in Q4 2025, driven primarily by enterprise subscription expansion and new logo acquisition in the financial services vertical. Gross margin improved to 78% from 74% in the prior year period, reflecting operating leverage in the cloud infrastructure stack.

## Key Findings

### Revenue Growth

Total revenue reached $47.2M in Q4 2025, up from $38.4M in Q4 2024 [[revenue-report:p3]]. The growth was broad-based across all segments:

- **Enterprise subscriptions**: $31.8M (+28% YoY) [[revenue-report:p5]]
- **Mid-market**: $11.2M (+15% YoY) [[revenue-report:p6]]
- **Self-serve**: $4.2M (+12% YoY) [[revenue-report:p7]]

### Margin Expansion

Gross margin expanded 400 basis points to 78%, driven by:

1. Migration of 60% of workloads to reserved instances [[cost-analysis:p2]]
2. Improved embedding model efficiency reducing inference costs by 35% [[cost-analysis:p4]]
3. Customer concentration in higher-margin enterprise tier [[revenue-report:p12]]

### Risk Factors

Customer concentration remains elevated. The top 5 customers represent 34% of ARR [[customer-report:p8]], down from 38% in Q3 but still above the 25% target. Loss of any top-5 customer would materially impact growth trajectory.

## Methodology

Analysis based on internal financial data (unaudited), customer CRM records, and cloud infrastructure billing. Revenue figures exclude professional services and one-time implementation fees. All comparisons are year-over-year unless stated otherwise.
