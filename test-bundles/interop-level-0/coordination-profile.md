# Sprint 14: Implement Rate Limiting Middleware

## Task

Implement rate limiting middleware for all public API endpoints. The middleware must support:

- Per-IP sliding window rate limiting
- Configurable limits per endpoint
- Redis-backed distributed state for multi-instance deployments
- Graceful degradation to in-memory when Redis is unavailable

## Context

This task emerged from the security review discussion on February 1 [[standup-notes:p2]]. The penetration test identified that the `/api/v1/tez/*/interrogate` endpoint has no rate limiting, allowing unbounded query volume per client. At current pricing, an attacker could run up significant compute costs via automated interrogation.

Sarah noted that the existing `RateLimitMiddleware` in `ragu-cache` handles in-memory limiting but does not support distributed state [[architecture-review:section-3.2]]. The decision was to extend the existing middleware rather than introduce a new dependency.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All public endpoints return `429 Too Many Requests` when limits are exceeded
2. Rate limit headers (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`) on every response
3. Redis integration with automatic fallback to in-memory
4. Tests covering: limit enforcement, header correctness, Redis failover, multi-instance consistency

## Status

- [x] Design document reviewed by Sarah
- [x] In-memory rate limiter implemented
- [ ] Redis backend integration
- [ ] Failover logic
- [ ] Tests
