## Risks and Headwinds

### Supply Chain

- **Polysilicon concentration**: China produces 82% of global polysilicon. Trade tensions and potential tariffs represent ongoing risk.
- **Shipping costs**: Container shipping rates from Asia to the U.S. increased 35% in H2 2025 due to Red Sea disruptions.
- **Module oversupply**: Chinese module manufacturers expanded capacity aggressively, leading to a 15-20% oversupply globally. This is compressing margins for manufacturers but reducing costs for developers and installers.

### Regulatory

- **Net metering reform**: Several U.S. states (California, Nevada, Connecticut) have revised net metering policies, reducing compensation for exported solar energy. This slows residential payback periods.
- **Interconnection queues**: U.S. interconnection queues now contain over **2,600 GW** of proposed projects, with average wait times exceeding 5 years. This is the primary bottleneck for utility-scale deployment.
- **Permitting**: Average residential permitting timelines vary from 2 weeks (Arizona) to 6 months (New York City), creating uneven market conditions.

### Financial

- **Interest rate environment**: The Federal Reserve's benchmark rate at 4.25% (as of Q4 2025) continues to elevate the cost of solar project financing relative to the near-zero rate environment of 2020-2021.
- **Tax equity availability**: IRA direct pay provisions have somewhat alleviated tax equity constraints, but demand still exceeds supply for complex project structures.
