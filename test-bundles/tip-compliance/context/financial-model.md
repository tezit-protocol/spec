|--------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| ARR (Year-End) | $16,400,000 | $30,500,000 | $52,000,000 | $78,000,000 |
| Revenue (Recognized) | $12,400,000 | $23,800,000 | $42,100,000 | $65,000,000 |

| Gross Margin | 71.0% | 73.0% | 75.0% | 76.5% |
| Operating Margin | -8.0% | -15.0% | -5.0% | 8.0% |

### Key Assumptions for Projections

1. **New customer acquisition**: 68 new customers in FY 2026 (same as FY 2025), growing to 95 in FY 2027 and 120 in FY 2028, driven by expanded sales team and channel partnerships.
2. **Net revenue retention**: NRR improves from 128% to 135% as product maturity increases upsell opportunities.
3. **Pricing**: No price increases modeled. All growth comes from volume and expansion.
4. **Gross margin improvement**: Driven by platform economies of scale and reduced implementation costs as the product becomes more self-serve.
5. **Operating margin**: Assumes a significant increase in sales & marketing spend in FY 2026 (post-Series B), with leverage improving in FY 2027-2028 as CAC payback improves.
6. **Series B capital**: Projections assume $25M Series B closes in Q1 2026, providing capital for growth investment.

### Path to Profitability

The model projects operating breakeven in **Q2 2028**, assuming:
- Revenue growth follows the trajectory above.
- R&D spend as a % of revenue declines from 35% to 22% by FY 2028.
- Sales & Marketing spend as a % of revenue declines from 30% to 25% by FY 2028.
- G&A remains roughly flat as a % of revenue.

Cumulative cash required to reach profitability (from January 2026): **$18.5 million**.
