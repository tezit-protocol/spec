## Overview

This document presents NovaTech AI's 3-year financial projections for the enterprise document processing market entry. The model includes base case, upside, and stress scenarios. All projections assume the market entry decision is made by Q1 2026, with initial customer acquisition beginning in Q2 2026.

## Current Financial Position

- **Total raised**: $12.0M (Seed: $2.8M, Series A: $9.2M)
- **Cash on hand**: $8.2M (as of November 1, 2025)
- **Monthly burn rate**: $585K (current, pre-market-entry)
- **Runway at current burn**: 14 months (through January 2027)
- **Headcount**: 32 (14 engineering, 6 product, 4 operations, 3 sales, 5 G&A)

## Table 1 - Revenue Projections (Base Case)

| Metric | 2026 (Y1) | 2027 (Y2) | 2028 (Y3) |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| New customers | 18 | 29 | 42 |
| Total customers (cumulative) | 18 | 47 | 89 |
| Churn rate | 0% | 6% | 8% |
| Average Contract Value (ACV) | $156K | $179K | $216K |
| Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) | **$2.8M** | **$8.4M** | **$19.2M** |
| Professional services revenue | $0.4M | $1.1M | $2.3M |
| Total revenue | $3.2M | $9.5M | $21.5M |

ACV growth is driven by upsell within existing accounts (expanded document types, higher volume tiers) and increasing pricing power as the product matures. Year 1 assumes no churn (12-month minimum contracts beginning Q2). Year 2 churn reflects expected loss of 1 customer; Year 3 churn reflects 4 customers.

## Table 2 - Unit Economics

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Gross margin (software) | 72% | 78% | 81% |
| Gross margin (blended incl. services) | 64% | 71% | 76% |
| Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) | $48K | $44K | $41K |
| Lifetime Value (LTV, 36-month) | $412K | $462K | $518K |
| LTV/CAC ratio | 8.6x | 10.5x | 12.6x |
| Net Revenue Retention (NRR) | -- | 118% | 124% |
| Payback period (months) | 3.7 | 3.0 | 2.3 |

CAC is blended across inbound (content marketing, developer community) and outbound (enterprise sales team) channels. Inbound CAC is projected at $22K; outbound CAC at $68K. The mix shifts toward inbound over time as brand recognition builds.

LTV calculation assumes 92% annual gross retention, 118-124% net revenue retention (expansion), and a 36-month customer lifetime horizon. Discount rate: 10%.

## Table 3 - Break-Even Analysis (Base Case)

| Quarter | Cumulative Customers | Quarterly Revenue | Quarterly Cost | Cumulative Cash Flow |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Q2 2026 | 4 | $0.3M | $1.1M | -$0.8M |
| Q3 2026 | 8 | $0.6M | $1.2M | -$1.4M |
| Q4 2026 | 13 | $0.9M | $1.2M | -$1.7M |
| Q1 2027 | 18 | $1.2M | $1.3M | -$1.8M |
| Q2 2027 | 28 | $1.8M | $1.4M | -$1.4M |
| **Q3 2027** | **47** | **$2.4M** | **$1.5M** | **+$0.5M** |
| Q4 2027 | 52 | $2.6M | $1.6M | +$1.5M |
| Q1 2028 | 61 | $3.2M | $1.7M | +$3.0M |

**Cash flow break-even is reached at 47 enterprise customers, projected for Q3 2027.** This is defined as the quarter where cumulative quarterly revenue exceeds cumulative quarterly operating costs on a sustained basis.

## Table 4 - Stress Scenario (30% Slower Acquisition)

Under the stress scenario, customer acquisition is 30% slower than the base case:

| Metric | Base Case | Stress Case | Delta |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Y1 customers | 18 | 13 | -28% |
| Y2 customers (cumulative) | 47 | 33 | -30% |
| Y2 ARR | $8.4M | $5.9M | -30% |
| Break-even quarter | Q3 2027 | Q1 2028 | +2 quarters |
| Additional funding required | $0 | $3.2M | -- |
| Runway exhaustion (without funding) | N/A | Q4 2027 | -- |

The stress scenario requires an additional $3.2M in funding (bridge round or early Series B) to reach break-even. Without additional funding, the company would exhaust its runway in Q4 2027, three months before reaching break-even.

## Section 5 - Runway Analysis

### Current Runway

With $8.2M cash on hand and a current monthly burn rate of $585K, NovaTech has **14 months of runway** at the current burn rate (through January 2027).

### Market Entry Impact on Runway

The market entry initiative requires the following upfront investments:

| Investment | Cost | Timeline |
|------------|------|----------|
| Model distillation (compute + personnel) | $340K | Q1 2026 |
| Sales team expansion (3 AEs + 1 SE) | $520K | Q1-Q2 2026 |
| SOC 2 Type II certification | $120K | Q1-Q2 2026 |
| Marketing launch (content, events, website) | $280K | Q1-Q2 2026 |
| Infrastructure buildout (GPU cluster) | $340K | Q1 2026 |
| Legal and compliance | $200K | Q1-Q2 2026 |
| **Total upfront investment** | **$1.8M** | -- |

Post-market-entry monthly burn increases to $780K (from $585K), reflecting the expanded sales team and infrastructure costs.

**Effective runway with market entry: 11 months** (through December 2026). This necessitates initiating Series B fundraising by Q2 2026, with a target close by Q3 2026.

### Series B Fundraising Scenario

Target raise: $25-30M at $100-120M pre-money valuation (based on comparable Series B rounds in AI infrastructure, 2024-2025 vintage). This would extend runway through 2028 and fund scaling to 89 customers.

Key metrics for Series B pitch:
- Demonstrable accuracy advantage on benchmarks
- 5+ signed enterprise customers (LOIs acceptable)
- Path to $10M+ ARR within 18 months of close
- Gross margins >70%

## Section 6 - Cost Structure

### Operating Expenses by Category (Base Case, Year 1)

| Category | Annual Cost | % of Revenue |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Engineering (R&D) | $3.8M | 119% |
| Sales & Marketing | $2.1M | 66% |
| Infrastructure (COGS) | $0.9M | 28% |
| General & Administrative | $1.4M | 44% |
| **Total Operating Expenses** | **$8.2M** | **256%** |

Year 1 operating expenses significantly exceed revenue, which is typical for enterprise SaaS companies in their first year of sales. The model projects operating expenses as a percentage of revenue declining to 98% by Year 3.

### Headcount Plan

| Role | Current | Y1 End | Y2 End | Y3 End |
|------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Engineering | 14 | 22 | 30 | 38 |
| Sales | 3 | 8 | 14 | 22 |
| Customer Success | 0 | 3 | 6 | 10 |
| Product | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 |
| G&A | 5 | 7 | 8 | 10 |
| Operations | 4 | 5 | 6 | 8 |
| **Total** | **32** | **53** | **74** | **100** |
