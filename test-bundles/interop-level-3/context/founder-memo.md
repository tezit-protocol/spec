# Strategic Rationale for Enterprise Document Processing Market Entry

**From:** Diana Park, CEO, NovaTech AI
**To:** NovaTech AI Board of Directors
**Date:** December 15, 2025
**Re:** Recommendation to proceed with enterprise document processing market entry

---

## p1 - Purpose

I am writing to recommend that the Board approve NovaTech AI's entry into the enterprise document processing market, with an initial investment of $1.8M and a target of 18 enterprise customers by year-end 2026.

This memo outlines the strategic rationale, summarizes the supporting analysis, and addresses the key risks and mitigations. Detailed supporting materials (market analysis, technical assessment, and financial projections) are provided as separate attachments.

## p2 - Background

NovaTech AI was founded in 2023 with the mission of building the most accurate multi-modal AI models for enterprise applications. We raised our Series A ($9.2M, led by Threshold Ventures) in March 2025 on the strength of our DocVision model's performance across academic benchmarks.

Since the Series A, we have been evaluating market entry options. The enterprise document processing market stands out as the highest-opportunity target for three reasons: large addressable market, clear accuracy-driven buying criteria, and limited penetration of modern AI approaches.

## p3 - Strategic Thesis

Our core thesis is that **NovaTech's native multi-modal architecture provides a durable competitive advantage** because the incumbent vendors are attempting to retrofit multi-modal capabilities onto fundamentally single-modal systems.

ABBYY's FineReader engine was built as an OCR system in 1989 and has been progressively enhanced with layout analysis and ML features. Kofax relies on partner models rather than building proprietary AI. Even Hyperscience, which has the most modern ML stack among the incumbents, built their system as a primarily visual model and later added text understanding.

NovaTech's DocVision was designed from the ground up as a multi-modal system, with text, layout, and visual features jointly processed through cross-attention layers. This architectural advantage manifests in two ways:

1. **Higher accuracy on complex documents**: Our 3.5 percentage point advantage on FUNSD (94.7% vs. 91.2% for ABBYY) is specifically because FUNSD tests form understanding, which requires simultaneous reasoning about text content, spatial layout, and visual formatting.

2. **Faster adaptation to new document types**: Our multi-modal pretraining means DocVision can understand a new document type with 50-100 examples, compared to 500-1000 examples required by single-modal systems. This dramatically reduces customer onboarding time.

I believe this advantage is durable for 2-3 years. Rebuilding a multi-modal architecture from scratch is a 12-18 month effort for an incumbent, and the switching costs for their existing customers create further inertia. By the time competitors catch up architecturally, we will have built our own moat through enterprise relationships, compliance certifications, and domain-specific fine-tuning.

## p4 - Why Now

Three factors make this the right time to enter:

1. **Market inflection**: The enterprise document processing market is accelerating (22.4% CAGR) driven by regulatory mandates and AI capability improvements. Delaying entry means facing more competition from other AI startups.

2. **Benchmark readiness**: DocVision v2.3 achieves state-of-the-art results across all major benchmarks. We have never had a stronger product to bring to market.

3. **Funding window**: The AI investment environment remains favorable for Series B fundraising. Our runway of 14 months gives us time to demonstrate product-market fit before raising, but only if we start now.

## p5 - Target Customer Profile

We will target enterprises with the following characteristics:

- **Document volume**: 500,000+ documents processed annually
- **Document diversity**: Mixed document types (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)
- **Current solution pain**: Dissatisfied with accuracy of existing vendor, or manual processing of document types their current vendor cannot handle
- **Industry**: Financial services (primary), insurance, healthcare (secondary)
- **Geography**: US-based (initial), expanding to UK and EU in Year 2

This profile represents approximately 2,400 enterprises in the US alone, of which we estimate 600-800 are actively evaluating new document processing solutions in any given year.

## p6 - Go-to-Market Approach

Our go-to-market strategy has three phases:

**Phase 1 (Q1-Q2 2026): Foundation**
- Complete model distillation to resolve latency issue
- Hire 3 enterprise account executives and 1 solutions engineer
- Obtain SOC 2 Type II certification
- Build proof-of-concept pipeline with 15-20 qualified prospects

**Phase 2 (Q3-Q4 2026): Initial Traction**
- Close first 10-15 enterprise customers
- Publish case studies and benchmark validations
- Establish 2-3 technology partnerships (cloud providers, system integrators)

**Phase 3 (2027): Scale**
- Expand sales team to 14 AEs
- Launch self-service tier for mid-market
- Begin geographic expansion (UK, Germany)

## p7 - Why Financial Services First

I recommend targeting financial services as our initial vertical for four reasons:

1. **Highest willingness to pay**: Financial services buyers pay 2.1x the cross-industry average ACV for document processing solutions. Our $156K target ACV is achievable in this segment.

2. **Strongest regulatory drivers**: KYC/AML compliance requirements create non-discretionary demand for document processing. This insulates us from budget-cutting cycles.

3. **Existing relationships**: Through our seed-stage advisory work with Meridian Capital Partners, we have relationships with 8 financial institutions that have expressed interest in piloting DocVision. Three of these have provided letters of intent contingent on SOC 2 certification.

4. **Reference value**: Financial services logos carry outsized reference value for subsequent verticals. Landing 5-7 financial services customers in Year 1 significantly de-risks our expansion into insurance and healthcare.

## p8 - Key Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Latency gap not resolved by distillation | Low (20%) | High | Fallback: offer batch-only processing initially, continue optimization |
| Slower than projected customer acquisition | Medium (35%) | High | Stress scenario modeled; bridge funding available from existing investors |
| Incumbent competitive response (price cuts) | Medium (40%) | Medium | Focus on accuracy differentiation; avoid price-sensitive segments |
| SOC 2 certification delays | Low (15%) | High | Engaged auditor (Schellman) in November; timeline confirmed |
| Key engineer departure | Medium (30%) | Medium | Retention packages for top 5 engineers; cross-training underway |

## p9 - Ask

I request Board approval for the following:

1. Approve market entry into enterprise document processing
2. Authorize $1.8M in upfront market entry investment
3. Approve hiring plan (8 net new hires in Q1 2026)
4. Authorize management to begin Series B preparation with target close by Q3 2026

I am confident that this represents the best use of NovaTech's technology and capital. The market opportunity is large, our technical advantage is real, and the timing is favorable. I look forward to discussing this at the December 20 Board meeting.

Respectfully,

**Diana Park**
Chief Executive Officer
